This is LITEVM as it began, a simple device driver. We're starting with this because we want
a VM that doesn't change the whole kernel. We'll accept a performance hit as the price to
pay. Can this be faster than NaCL? We'll see.

We started here:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/kvm/files/kvm-kmod/
